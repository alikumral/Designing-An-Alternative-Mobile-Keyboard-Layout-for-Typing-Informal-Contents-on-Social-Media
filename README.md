# Creating An Alternative Mobile Keyboard Layout for Typing Informal Contents on Social Media
 Our main purpose is to design a keyboard that provides its users with an agile and easy typing experience in social media environments. Our focus will be on teenagers who utilize abbreviations and emojis frequently in their shares. Additionally, we will work on a digital keyboard optimized for mobile phones, as the vast majority of the content is created by that specific age group via mobile phones. After obtaining the basic features a layout design must have in order to be efficient, we will apply these features to design a mobile “social media keyboard” which will be viable to type in social media contexts and environments. Finally, we will compare our keyboard prototype with other keyboard layouts that are ubiquitous nowadays or are claimed to be efficient. To be able to accomplish this purpose, we will narrow our data resources down to social media messages shared by subjects who are at a determined age interval.
